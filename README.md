# Luma3DS-updater
Updater for Luma3DS in lpp-3ds

#Usage
Simply install the cia, or run the script from lpp-3ds.3dsx
You'll need a file named updater.cfg on the root of the SD containing the path to the Luma3DS file (including the first "/", maximum length of 38 characters)

#Build
To make a cia out of it, you'll need a .elf of lpp-3ds (I provided one, but you can find newer ones [here](http://rinnegatamante.it/lpp-3ds.php ))
makerom, bannertool and 3dstool added to your PATH (also provided here)
Then, simply run the .bat (or .sh if you're not on Windows)
